# Runbooks

Operational procedures for the template-netlify project.

## Overview

This directory holds step-by-step runbooks for common operational tasks. As the project is a minimal static site template, operational procedures are currently minimal.

## Adding Runbooks

When operational procedures are needed, add them here as individual markdown files. Examples:

- `incident-response.md` — Steps for responding to site outages
- `secret-rotation.md` — Process for rotating Netlify credentials
- `rollback.md` — How to roll back a bad deployment
