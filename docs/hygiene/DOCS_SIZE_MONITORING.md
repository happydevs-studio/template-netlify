# Documentation Size Monitoring Implementation

## Summary

You now have a complete local documentation size monitoring system that replicates the GitHub Actions workflow functionality. This allows you to check documentation size and quality locally as part of your development workflow.

## What Was Created

### 1. **Scripts** (Located in `.scripts/`)

#### `.scripts/check-docs-size.sh`
- Main script that analyzes documentation size against thresholds
- Counts markdown files and calculates total size, token estimates, and file sizes  
- Checks against configured thresholds (150 KB total, 20 KB per file, 15 max files)
- Generates a detailed markdown report to `.docs-reports/docs-size-report.md`
- Uses color-formatted output for easy readability
- Executable script - runs with: `bash .scripts/check-docs-size.sh`

#### `.scripts/generate-docs-size-report.py`
- Python script that generates formatted markdown reports
- Creates a rich report with statistics, largest files, thresholds, and recommendations
- Includes timestamp of when the report was generated
- Automatically called by the shell script

### 2. **Taskfile Integration**

Added two new tasks in `Taskfile.yml`:

#### `task hygiene:docs-size`
```bash
task hygiene:docs-size
```
- Monitor documentation size and check against all thresholds
- Generates a detailed report
- Integrated into the `hygiene:test` task suite

#### Updated `hygiene:test`
- Now includes the new `hygiene:docs-size` check
- Runs all documentation hygiene checks: lint, structure, size, and docs-size

### 3. **Documentation** (in `docs/hygiene/README.md`)

Created comprehensive documentation that includes:
- Overview of documentation hygiene checks
- Detailed explanation of each check
- Quick reference command examples
- When to run the checks
- Threshold rationale (optimized for AI context windows)
- Recommendations for remediation

### 4. **Configuration**

Updated `.gitignore` to exclude:
- `.docs-reports/` - Generated report directory

## Configured Thresholds

- **Total documentation size:** max 150 KB
- **Individual file sizes:** max 20 KB  
- **Number of documentation files:** max 15

These thresholds are designed to:
1. Keep documentation within AI context windows
2. Maintain document readability
3. Keep navigation simple
4. Support rapid iteration and refactoring

## Usage

### Run locally
```bash
# Run just the docs size check
task hygiene:docs-size

# Run all hygiene checks
task hygiene:test

# Run the shell script directly
bash .scripts/check-docs-size.sh
```

### View reports
The generated report is saved to: `.docs-reports/docs-size-report.md`

It contains:
- Documentation statistics (file count, total size, token estimates)
- List of largest files
- Status (pass/fail against thresholds)
- Any alerts or violations
- Recommendations for improvement

## How It Works

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Finds all `.md` files in `docs/` (excluding archive)
   - Calculates total size in KB
   - Counts files and average file size
   - Estimates token count (rough: 1 token per 4 bytes)

2. **Validation Phase**
   - Checks total documentation size against 150 KB limit
   - Checks individual file sizes against 20 KB limit
   - Checks file count against 15 file limit
   - Identifies any violations

3. **Reporting Phase**
   - Displays formatted output to terminal
   - Generates markdown report for archiving
   - Provides recommendations if thresholds exceeded

## Example Output

```
📚 Documentation Size Monitor
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 Documentation Statistics:
  Total Files:        15
  Total Size:         41 KB
  Estimated Tokens:   ~10627
  Average File Size:  2 KB

✅ Status: Within acceptable limits
```

## Integration with CI/CD

This setup works alongside the existing GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/hygiene-docs-size-check.yml`). You can now:

1. **Run locally** before committing: `task hygiene:docs-size`
2. **Get fast feedback** on documentation size changes
3. **Identify issues early** before pushing to the repository
4. **Review detailed reports** to find optimization opportunities

## Next Steps

- Run `task hygiene:docs-size` regularly as part of your development workflow
- Check `.docs-reports/docs-size-report.md` for detailed analysis
- Consider running the full `task hygiene:test` suite before commits
- Monitor the report as documentation grows to stay within thresholds
