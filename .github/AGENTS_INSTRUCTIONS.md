# Agent Instructions

All agent instructions have been moved to [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) in the root directory to establish an open standard for all tooling (GitHub Copilot, Claude, automated agents, etc.).

Please refer to [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the current project conventions and guidelines.
